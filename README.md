# Oh, you see!
Our 2015 SRDP project

A mobile app for look and found ecards.


As fail to connect the database of EcardWeb, I'm 
trying to parse the website: ecard.ouc.edu.cn.
If conditions permit, the Lost and Found function
moudle will be supported by a separate server. 

Another repo "EasyEcard" is based on this project,
which is implement by parsing EcardWeb completely.
